                <p>Hotel Kleopatra Atlas is a perfect place to stay in Alanya. It is close to the beach. The room was
                    very pleasant, it was cozy and clean. Breakfast was excellent and incredibly varied. The hotel team
                    has always been friendly, patient and helpful. That impressed me the most. No matter what time of
                    day or night, you could turn to them with all your concerns. On my next stays, I will definitely
                    check into Hotel Kleopatra Atlas again. The price performance ratio is very good.</p>
